- HTML div tags are used to divide a web page into sections, or "divisions," that can be used to create a layout structure. By using div tags, developers can create different sections of the page, such as a header, footer, and main content area, and control the position and size of each section.

- In this project, it demonstrate how to use div tags to divide a web page into columns and rows. This can be done by creating multiple divs and positioning them next to or on top of each other. The developer can also use CSS to control the size and position of the divs to create a grid-like layout. This grid layout can be used to create a more organized and visually pleasing design for the page.

- In addition, the project may also cover responsive design, which is the ability for a web page to adjust its layout based on the screen size of the device it is being viewed on. This can be accomplished by using CSS media queries to apply different styles to the divs depending on the screen size.

- Overall, the goal of this project is to show developers how to effectively use HTML div tags and CSS to create a well-organized, visually appealing, and responsive web page layout.
